# mini Piano

### WWDC '18 Scholarship project - accepted submission

mini Piano is an interactive playground which lets you play the piano. With only two octaves you can play many songs and mini Piano presents how to play two songs.

When you press the piano's key you can see what tone was generated. It helps people who have never played the musical instrument.

You can define your own song by providing an array of Note enum and speed using the playSong() method from Piano class.

    - public func playSong(with notes: [Note], speed: TimeInterval, chosenSong: Song) { }
